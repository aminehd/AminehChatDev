500 Rummy is a card game played with two players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 500 points by forming sets and runs with the cards in your hand.

Here are the basic rules of the game:

1. Each player is dealt 7 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards.

2. On your turn, you can either draw a card from the deck or pick up the top card from the discard pile.

3. After drawing a card, you must discard one card from your hand.

4. The game continues with players taking turns drawing and discarding cards until one player reaches 500 points.

5. Points are scored by forming sets (3 or 4 cards of the same rank) and runs (3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit).

6. At the end of each round, players calculate their points based on the cards they have formed into sets and runs.

7. The game ends when one player reaches 500 points. The player with the highest score wins.
