## 3. How to Play <a name="how-to-play"></a>

500 Rummy is a two-player card game. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in your hand.

Here are the basic rules of the game:

1. Each player is dealt a hand of cards from a shuffled deck.

2. On their turn, a player can choose to discard one card from their hand.

3. The discarded card is drawn by the opponent player, who adds it to their hand.

4. The game continues with players taking turns until one player has no cards left in their hand.

5. The player who gets rid of all their cards first wins the game.

6. If both players run out of cards in their hands at the same time, the game is a draw.

7. The game can be played multiple times by clicking the "Start Game" button again.
